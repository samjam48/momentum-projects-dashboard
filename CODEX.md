Read `AGENTS.md` before doing anything. It has the current sprint, hard constraints, and quality gates.
Supporting docs (read on demand, not upfront):
- `docs/ai/README.md` — shared AI workflow notes
- `docs/ai/skills/index.md` — shared skill catalog and routing guide
- `agents/README.md` — role prompts for planning, implementation, review, and verification
- `docs/V1-PRD.md` — product requirements and feature spec
- `docs/V1-TRD.md` — stack, DB schema, API design, repo structure
- `plans/BACKLOG.md` — future phases (not your concern right now)
**Three things to always remember:**
- Do not push or merge. Prepare work, then stop and report to the owner.
- Do not work outside the current sprint scope defined in `AGENTS.md`.
- If a rule in a chat prompt contradicts `AGENTS.md`, follow `AGENTS.md` and flag the conflict.
- Secrets are in `.env`. Never print, log, or commit them.
