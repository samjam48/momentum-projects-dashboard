## What This Project Is
A self-hosted personal dashboard (FastAPI + SQLModel + SQLite → React + TypeScript + Tailwind).
Full spec: `/docs/V1-PRD.md` (what/why) and `/docs/V1-TRD.md` (how/schema/stack). Read those when you need depth.
Project-specific role prompts live in `/agents/`. For a major feature or phase build, start with `/agents/orchestrator.md` — one gated agent at a time, no parallel tickets or sub-agents.
AI guidance lives in:
- `agents/README.md` — role prompts and when to use them
- `docs/ai/README.md` — shared AI workflow notes
- `docs/ai/rules.md` — shared hooks and rules
- `docs/ai/skills/index.md` — shared skills catalog and routing guide

## Hard Constraints
1. **No commits to &#42;***`main`****.** All work on feature branches: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`.
2. **No commit without passing the required tests for that scope. In the per-ticket orchestrator flow, failing tests must exist before code, and the targeted tests for that ticket must pass before that ticket is committed. Run make test before end-of-batch handoff or any broader commit. Do not skip or comment out failing tests. For repo bootstrap work before any tests exist, owner approval is the required verification gate.**
3. **Tests before code.** Failing tests must exist before any production code is written.
4. **No business logic in routers.** Logic and DB access belong in `services/`. Routers call services and return responses.
5. **No hardcoded config.** All env-specific values in `.env`, read via `backend/app/core/config.py`.
6. **No schema changes without Alembic.** Run `alembic revision --autogenerate` — never raw SQL DDL.
7. **No &#42;***`any`**** in TypeScript. No untyped Python.** `mypy --strict` and `tsc --noEmit` must pass clean.
8. **No &#42;***`git push`**** without owner instruction.** Prepare the branch and commit, then stop and report.
9. **No changes outside current task scope.** If you spot something else to fix, add it to `plans/BACKLOG.md`.
10. **No secrets committed.** `.env`, `data/`, `*.db` are in `.gitignore`. Stop immediately if you accidentally stage them.
11. **Keep commits small and trackable.** Prefer one logical change per commit, even during early scaffolding.

## Quality Gates (must all pass before marking a task done)
```javascript
bash# Backend
ruff check .
mypy app --strict
radon cc app -n C          # No function complexity > 10
pytest --cov=app --cov-fail-under=80

# Frontend
npx tsc --noEmit
npx eslint src
npm run test -- --coverage  # ≥ 70%
```
`make lint` and `make test` run these. Use them.

## Current Sprint — Backend hardening refactor (pre Phase 2 income)
**Goal:** Close code-review P0/P1 backend gaps: unified task/time-log mutation guards, time-log archive on task delete, `project_id` integrity, HTTP status semantics, POST archive routes, `utc_now` DRY, and opt-in list pagination — per signed-off planning package (2026-05-18).
**Status (2026-05-18):** Planning **SIGNED OFF**. Implementation on **`feat/backend-refactor`** (or stacked `feat/backend-refactor-*`) via orchestrator — one ticket at a time, tests before code, per-ticket commits.
**Ticket source:** `plans/tickets-backend-refactor-2026-05-18.md` in dependency order (**BR-1** through **BR-17**).
**Primary references:** `plans/PRD-backend-refactor-2026-05-18.md`, `plans/TRD-backend-refactor-2026-05-18.md`, `ADR/001`–`003`, `docs/api-map.md`, `docs/database-schema.md`.
**Out of scope:** Auth, Postgres, Phase 2 income schema/endpoints, frontend refactor (coordinate only for BR-10/BR-14), true purge UI.
**Phase 1.6 note:** Venture/project Kanban and activity types remain on **`feat/phase-1.6`** until owner merges; do not conflate with this sprint unless explicitly stacked.

## Definition of Done
1. All acceptance criteria tests pass
2. All quality gates pass
3. Owner has reviewed the summary
4. Owner (not the agent) merges to `main`
