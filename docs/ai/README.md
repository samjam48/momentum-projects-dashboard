# AI Guidance

Repo-wide rules still start in `AGENTS.md`.

Use the files here to keep role prompts, skills, and tool-specific adapters aligned:
- `docs/ai/skills/index.md` is the shared skill catalog and routing guide.
- `docs/ai/skills/*.md` are the canonical skill bodies.
- `.claude/skills/*` and `.cursor/rules/*` are thin adapters that should point back here instead of duplicating guidance.

## Start-Work Checklist

For any non-trivial task:
1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Identify whether the task is planning, implementation, testing, review, or verification.
3. Open the relevant role prompt in `agents/` if using the role workflow.
4. Check `docs/ai/skills/index.md` for matching skills.
5. Read only the project docs needed for the affected area.

## Source Of Truth

- Role prompts: `agents/*.md`
- Cross-cutting architecture and writing conventions: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/patterns.md`
- Shared decision skills: `docs/ai/skills/*.md`
- Tool-specific adapters: `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `.claude/skills/*`, `.cursor/rules/*`
